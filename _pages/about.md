Hi folks, I am a senior Computer Science undergrad at IIT Delhi. I am broadly interested in Machine Learning and Finance. I will be joining Quadeye [Font Awesome icons](https://www.quadeye.com/) in 2024 where I will be involved in designing High Frequency strategies to make markets more efficient. 

I like to talk about arbitrage and opportunities to make money systematically - including businesses and startups. Feel free to discuss if you have some ideas

I am currently working as a Researcher at Abacus AI, making architechtural changes to LLMs to improve on arithmetic tasks. I am also working with Prof. Mausam and Prof. Parag Singla on using Large Language Models for Planning. I have previously worked with Prof. Ashish Chiplunkar on Prophet Inequalities with Shortlists and for a very short duration at Yale where I improved spike detection systems in Brain Computing Interfaces.

I enjoy reading Physics and Philosophy - read the [blog](/al-folio/blog/). I play cricket and chess.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
