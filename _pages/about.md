Hi folks, I am a senior Computer Science undergrad at IIT Delhi. I am broadly interested in Machine Learning and Finance. I will be joining Quadeye [Font Awesome icons](https://www.quadeye.com/) in 2024 where I will be involved in designing High Frequency strategies to make markets more efficient. 

I like to talk about arbitrage and opportunities to make money systematically - including businesses and startups. Feel free to discuss if you have some ideas

I am currently working as a Researcher at Abacus AI, making architechtural changes to LLMs to improve on arithmetic tasks. I am also working with Prof. Mausam and Prof. Parag Singla on using Large Language Models for Planning. I have previously worked with Prof. Ashish Chiplunkar on Prophet Inequalities with Shortlists and for a very short duration at Yale where I improved spike detection systems in Brain Computing Interfaces.

I enjoy reading Physics and Philosophy - read the [blog](/al-folio/blog/). I play cricket and chess.
